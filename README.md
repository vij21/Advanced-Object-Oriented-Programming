To Do List:  
A simple class for representing points in 2D Cartesian coordinates. Every
Point2D instance has an x and y coordinate.

What I Learned:   
You should not duplicate the computation of the x and y coordinate in hypo().
Use hypoX() and hypoY() to compute the coordinates.


Learn to return the sum of the integers 1 through n where n is a strictly positive
integer.

Created a turtle at location position with an angle of 0.0 degrees and a pen color of Color.BLACK. The turtle is responsible for its own position. The starting position must be inside the square with corners (0.0, 0.0)and (1.0, 1.0), otherwise an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
